## Course Overview

### About the Course
STAT 453 introduces the fundamental concepts, methods, and tools used in machine learning, deep learning, and generative modeling. The course focuses on understanding both the ideas behind machine learning methods and how to apply them in practice.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning (ML) is a way of creating programs that improve their performance at a task through experience. More formally, a program is considered to learn from experience $E$ with respect to a task $T$ and performance measure $P$ if its performance at task $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$.

This definition can be broken down into three important components:

- **Task ($T$):** What the machine learning system is trying to accomplish.
- **Experience ($E$):** The data or interactions that the system learns from.
- **Performance measure ($P$):** How we determine whether the system is performing well.

Traditional programming and machine learning differ in how the program is created. In traditional programming, the programmer provides a program that takes inputs and produces outputs. In machine learning, the computer uses inputs and outputs to learn a program.

### Three Fundamental Questions in Machine Learning

When building a machine learning system, there are three fundamental questions to consider:

1. **Representation:** How should we represent the problem and the information contained in the data?
   
   In probabilistic form, suppose we have variables $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_8$. To represent the joint distribution of all eight variables, if each variable is Boolean, there are $2^8 = 256$ possible configurations of the variables. By using the conditional independence relationships between variables, a graphical model can represent the same joint distribution using far fewer parameters.

2. **Inference:** Given the representation, what can we conclude or predict about unknown information?
   
   In probabilistic form, suppose we want to determine the probability of one variable given another:

    $$
    P(X_8 \mid X_1)
    $$

   Using the definition of conditional probability:

   $$
   P(X_8 \mid X_1) = \frac{P(X_8, X_1)}{P(X_1)}
   $$

   If the other variables are unobserved, we can marginalize over them:

   $$
   P(X_8 \mid X_1) =
   \frac{\sum_{X_2,\ldots,X_7} P(X_1,\ldots,X_8)}
   {P(X_1)}
   $$

   For Boolean variables, this requires summing over $2^6$ configurations of the six unobserved variables. Independence assumptions can simplify this calculation. Graphical models can be useful because they provide an intermediate representation between explicitly representing every possibility and assuming complete independence.

3. **Learning:** How can we use available data or experience to learn the appropriate model? What model is "right" for the data?
   
   In probabilistic form,

   $$
   M = \underset{M \in \mathcal{H}}{\operatorname{argmax}} \; F(D; M)
   $$

   where:

   - $M$ is the selected model.
   - $\mathcal{H}$ is the hypothesis space, or set of possible models.
   - $D$ is the available data.
   - $F(D; M)$ is a function that evaluates how well model $M$ fits or performs on the data.

   An important question in learning is how to constrain the hypothesis space $\mathcal{H}$ so that we can efficiently search for a useful model rather than considering every possible model.

## The Broad Categories of ML

### 1. Supervised Learning

- Labeled data
- Direct feedback
- Trying to predict some outcome

#### Regression

- Function that predicts Y from X

#### Classification

- Observe examples from different classes
- Learn a boundary/rule that separates them

#### Definition

**Task (T):**
- Learn a function (h) that maps X → Y

**Experience (E):**
- Labeled samples containing both X and Y

**Performance (P):**
- A measure of how accurate (h) is

### 2. Unsupervised Learning

- There are no Y/labels, only inputs (X)
- **Goal:** Find hidden structure or patterns in the data
- **Examples:** PCA, clustering, autoencoders

#### Definition

**Task (T):**
- Discover structure in the data

**Experience (E):**
- A set of X values with no Y labels

**Performance (P):**
- Measure of fit

### 3. Reinforcement Learning

- Instead of every X being mapped to a Y, the goal is to learn which actions lead to the best expected reward

#### Example: LLM Feedback

- A model generates outputs/conversations
- Humans provide feedback such as a thumbs-up/down or preference
- That feedback provides a reward signal

#### Definition

**Task (T):**
- Learn a policy (π) mapping states to actions

**Experience (E):**
- Interaction with the environment

**Performance (P):**
- Expected reward

## The Supervised Learning Workflow

### Training vs. Testing Data

In supervised learning:

#### Training Data

- Contains observed inputs and outputs
- Used to learn the model's parameters

#### Testing Data

- Kept separate from training
- Used to evaluate how well the learned parameters model real phenomena

### Structured vs. Unstructured Data

#### Structured Data

Usually organized into:
- Tables
- Matrices

#### Unstructured Data

- Images
- Natural language
